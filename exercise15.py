#Exercise 15: Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.
#Note here exp is a non-negative integer, and the base is an integer.

base = 5
exponent = 4

result = base ** exponent

print(f"The result of {base} raised to the power of {exponent} is: {result}")
